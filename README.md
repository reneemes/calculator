# Calculator

This calculator app features a clean, responsive interface built with HTML and CSS, using a grid-based layout for all number buttons, operators, and additional controls. It adapts smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices for an accessible user experience.

Interactive functionality is powered by JavaScript, enabling users to enter numbers, perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and interact using either on-screen buttons or keyboard input. The display updates dynamically to show inputs, operations, and results, and includes a clear button to reset the calculator at any time.
